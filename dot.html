        <li class="wordss"><b>Aggregate function </b> - performs a calculation on a set of values, and returns a single value.</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Anomaly</b> - A person or thing that is different from what is usual, or not in agreement with something else and therefore not satisfactory</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Bidirectional</b> - A bidirectional relationships mean that the flow of data is mutual between the related forms. With same example, let's assume the relationship between the Employee Profile and Manager Details is a two way or bidirectional relationship. </li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Cardinality of Projection </b> - The result of a projection contains at most as many tuples as the operand without changing values.</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Cascade delete </b> - means that if a record in the parent table is deleted, then the corresponding records in the child table will automatically be deleted. This is called a cascade delete in SQL Server.</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Character domain</b> - is used with single character or string attributes</li>

        <li class="wordss"><b>Dynamic online catalog based on the relational model </b> - The metadata must be stored and managed as ordinary data – that is, in tables within the database. Such data must be available to authorized users using the standard database relational language.</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>End users </b> - are those who actually reap the benefits of having a DBMS.</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Entity</b> - An entity in an ER Model is a real-world entity having properties called attributes.</li>

        <li class="wordss"><b>High-level insert, update and delete </b> - The database must support set-level inserts, updates, and deletes.</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Inheritance</b> - Heredity, also called inheritance or biological inheritance, is the passing on of traits from parents to their offspring; either through asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction, the offspring cells or organisms acquire the genetic information of their parents.</li>

        <li class="wordss"><b>Integrity Constraints </b> - are the protocols that a table's data columns must follow. These are used to restrict the types of information that can be entered into a table. This means that the data in the database is accurate and reliable.</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Integrity independence </b> - All relational integrity constraints must be definable in the relational language stored in the system catalog, not at the application level.</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Intervals</b> - are used to represent a measure of time. </li>

        <li class="wordss"><b>Like Clause </b> - Like is used in condition expressions when a pattern is instead of an exact value.</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Logical data independence </b> - Applications programs and ad hoc facilities are logically unaffected when changes are made to the table structures that preserve the original table values (changing order of columns or inserting columns).</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Matrix</b> - Matrix is an arrangement of numbers into rows and columns. Make your first introduction with matrices and learn about their dimensions and elements. A matrix is a rectangular arrangement of numbers into rows and columns. For example, matrix A has two rows and three columns.</li>

        <li class="wordss"><b>Outer Join</b> - If no match is found for a tuple, we can join it with a null tuple. This is called outer join.</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Physical data independence </b> - Applications and ad hoc facilities are logically unaffected when physical access methods or storage structures are changed.</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Primary Key </b> - A primary key is a candidate key that is most appropriate to be the main reference key for the table.</li>

        <li class="wordss"><b>Relationship</b> - The logical association among entities is called relationship.</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Renaming</b> - changes attribute names without changing values.</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Schema</b> - A schema, or scheme, is an abstract concept proposed by J. Piaget to refer to our, well, abstract concepts. Schemas (or schemata) are units of understanding that can be hierarchically categorized as well as webbed into complex relationships with one another.</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Selection</b> - Selection operation produces a schema as its operand.</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Semantic</b> - Semantics is the study of reference, meaning, or truth. The term can be used to refer to subfields of several distinct disciplines, including philosophy, linguistics and computer science.</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Software </b> - is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks.</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>SQL INTERSECT </b> - operator combines two select statements and returns only the dataset that is common in both the statements. </li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Structured Query Language (SQL)-</b> - is a standardized programming language that is used to manage relational databases and perform various operations on the data in them.</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>SUM function adds values </b> - You can add individual values, cell references or ranges or a mix of all three. </li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Surrogate Keys </b> - A surrogate key is a unique key for an entity in the client's business or for an object in the database. Sometimes natural keys cannot be used to create a unique primary key of the table. This is when the data modeler or architect decides to use surrogate or helping keys for a table in the LDM.</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Systematic treatment </b> - Nulls must be represented and treated in a systematic way, independent of data type.</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Tables  </b> - In relational data model, relations are saved in the format of Tables. This format stores the relation among entities. A table has rows and columns, where a row represents records and columns represent the attributes.</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Transitive</b> - A transitive verb is a verb that accepts one or more objects. This contrasts with intransitive verbs, which do not have objects. Transitivity is traditionally thought of as a global property of a clause, by which activity is transferred from an agent to a patient.</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Tuple</b> - A single row of a table, which contains a single record for that relation is called a tuple.</li>
        <li class="wordss"><b>UNIQUE constraint</b> - ensures that all values in a column are different. Both the UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints provide a guarantee for uniqueness for a column or set of columns.</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>Update Query </b> - is an action query (SQL statement) that changes a set of records according to criteria (search conditions) you specify. It's a very powerful feature and a fundamental part of relational databases since you can modify a huge number of records at one time.</li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b>View updating</b> - Any view that is theoretically updatable must be updatable through the system.</li>
        <li class="wordss"><b></b>  </li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b></b>  </li> 
        <li class="wordss"><b></b>  </li>
